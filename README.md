As our End-term project, we decided to create an FBI database.
When you log in to the program, you are greeted with a password where you need to enter 123 to open access. But remember that you only have 3 attempts, and then the program will be suspended.
We have 16 different classes and interfaces and more than 20 different methods. We also sorted the actions so as not to clog the menu.
